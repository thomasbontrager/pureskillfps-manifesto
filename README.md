# PureSkillFPS Manifesto

PureSkillFPS exists to raise the standard for First Person Shooter games,
streaming, and creator infrastructure.

We believe:
- Performance matters
- Fair play matters
- Tools should empower hardware, not punish it
- Communities must be safe, focused, and welcoming
- Builders deserve real platforms, not toys

PureSkillFPS is a place to:
- Build
- Learn
- Play
- Create
- Collaborate

This manifesto defines our direction.
It will evolve as the ecosystem grows.
